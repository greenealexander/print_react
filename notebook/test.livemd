# CUPS

## How to talk to CUPS?

The HTTP and IPP protocols are used to communicate between the application and the CUPS server. A minimal IPP client has been implemented and can be used by doing the following:

```elixir
alias IPP.{Printer, Request}

printer = Printer.new("HP_OfficeJet_Pro_8710")

Request.execute(:get_printer_attributes, printer)
```

First, you create an `%IPP.Printer{}` struct with the name of the printer. Then you call `IPP.Request.execute/2` passing an operation and the printer.
